<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>We implemented rasterization and different techniques in texture mapping and compared and contrasted the different ways to execute each technique. We also compared the final rendered images to see the anti-aliasing effects.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>We create a bounding box and run the three-line test on each sample point in the bounding box to see if the point is within the triangle. If so, we fill it with color. Since we are checking each sample within the bounding box once, the runtime is exactly the runtime of <i>"one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle."</i></p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>Assuming basic rasterization works, our supersampling algorithm takes more samples per pixel and adds it to the sample_buffer, so that each pixel gets X spots in the 2-dimensional buffer instead of 1 for a sample rate of X. Then, when drawing in the frame buffer, we average the X values to find the color of the pixel. The main modification to the pipeline is adding centered subpixels to sample from, dynamically changing the size of the sample buffer based on the sampling rate, and averaging the values in fill_value. This average creates gradients that makes antialias the slanted edges, smoothing out the jaggedy edges.</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task_2_s1.png" align="middle" width="300px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Supersampling rate 1 per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task_2_s4.png" align="middle" width="300px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Supersampling rate 4 per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>

        <figcaption align="middle">Supersampling rate 16 per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>We see that as the supersampling rate goes up, the pixel inspector shows the edges of this triangle becoming smoother. As we sample more subpixels per pixel, the average of the pixel color smooths out the edges. Instead of just being 0 or 1, the gradient creates the illusion of an angled edge. This gradient becomes more precise as we sample more because there are more averages/shades possible.</p>

<div align="middle">

  <figcaption align="middle">Updated fun robot</figcaption>
</div>

<p>We changed the colors to give the robot a t-shirt and jean shorts. We also popped its left calf up (and closer to the center) and moved its right forearm up too, so that it would look like it's doing a cutesy dance in its new outfit.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<div align="middle">
  <img src="images/barycentric_coords_example.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
  <figcaption align="middle">Barycentric Coordinates Example</figcaption>
</div>

<p>Barycentric coordinates are another system of coordinates used to describe where a point is within a triangle by referring to how close it is to each of the 3 vertices. In the example above, you can see that each of the vertices is directly on themselves and thus not close to any of the others, making their coordinates a 1 and two 0's, depending on which vertex. For the middle point, it is the centroid, so it is exactly (1/3, 1/3,  1/3), as each vertex is having the same "influence" on the distance.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p>Pixel sampling is used to determine the color or texture of pixels in a rendered image, referenced from a texture map, in cases that it's not a 1:1 mapping, like mapping from a 2D image to a 3D image. The two methods include nearest neighbor, which takes the 2D pixel that is closest in location to the pixel we're trying to map out on the rendered image and using its color/properties, and bilinear, which takes the weighted average of the closest couple of pixels. To find the corresponding pixel location from the texture map to the rendered image, we use the barycentric coordinates.</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/nearest_1.png" align="middle" width="200px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest, 1 sample </figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/bilinear_1.png" align="middle" width="200px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear, 1 sample </figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/nearest_16.png" align="middle" width="200px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest, 16 samples </figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/bilinear_16.png" align="middle" width="200px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear, 16 samples</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>We can see that supersampling still has a big effect, but for small details like these letters, bilinear sampling creates a much smoother image, especially at the level of 1 sample per pixel. The lines are just much smoother. Bilinear would also be the better method when it comes to extreme magnication, as the weighted averages are more likely to extrapolate details, while using the nearest pixel color would be like having a low resolution image on a high resolution TV, as it's not able to clear up the details.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>We implemented the 3 modes of levels: 0, nearest, and linear. 0 always samples from the original texture map. Nearest uses the formula from lecture and rounds it to find the appropriate mipmap level corresponding to the Jacobian input to sample from.Linear averages the samples taken from the nearest level from above and below, to generate a smoother, linearized output.</p>

<p>Between the 3 techniques, pixel sampling is a little faster and memory-efficient, as it doesn't have to store lots of information like multiple mipmap levels. If using nearest neighbor pixel sampling method, it is even faster, at the cost of anti-aliasing power. Using level mapping helps a lot with anti-aliasing, but requires more calculation and storage to get the most efficient combination of levels. However, using different levels instead of always using level 0 could speed up the process a bit. Supersampling has a lot of anti-aliasing power, but as it increases, so do number of calculations and amount of storage needed to store the samples.</p>
